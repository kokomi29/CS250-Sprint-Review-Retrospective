# CS250-Sprint-Review-Retrospective
Glorimar O’Conner López

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
During the SNHU Travel project, I learned how important it is to truly understand user needs before building anything. Creating user stories helped translate those needs into small, actionable features with clear acceptance criteria. For example, when the travel search filters were implemented, the Product Owner role clarified what users needed and why it mattered, ensuring the Developer role focused on delivering a booking experience that aligned with business value. User stories removed assumptions and kept development centered on the functionality that made the greatest impact. 


**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Agile taught me to build software in manageable increments instead of trying to finish everything at once. Our team adapted frequently using sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. When we misjudged the complexity of the secure login feature, we divided it into separate front-end and back-end stories to maintain momentum. That flexibility kept the project moving and prevented delays. In the future, I want to continue using backlog refinement, planning poker, and open communication so that projects can evolve without losing sight of user value.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team member means staying engaged, communicating clearly, and supporting shared goals. During this project, I encouraged daily progress updates, identified blockers early, and sent reminders that helped the team stay aligned during sprints. Collaboration tools like Trello and shared Google Docs helped maintain transparency and accountability while contributing to a positive dynamic. I learned that software development thrives when team members build trust, participate actively, and celebrate improvements after each iteration.
